I&#8217;m not a food blogger.  If you have somehow managed to stumble onto this site, this is just a collection of recipes that I&#8217;ve vetted and adjusted for my own use.  You are, of course, welcome to try them out.  In situations where I remember where I got the recipe, the original source is linked. If no source is given, it may be:

  1. a family recipe
  2. cobbled together via trial and error from too many variations to point at a specific source
  3. copied from a newspaper or usenet group rec.food.recipes too long ago to remember
