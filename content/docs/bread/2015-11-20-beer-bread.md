1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer  
3 cups self-rising flour  
1/3 cup white sugar

1. In a large bowl, mix together the sugar and flour. Add beer and continue to mix. Batter will be sticky. Pour into a 9 x 5 inch greased loaf pan. Optional: melt 2 TBSP butter and pour over top.

2. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees ) for 50 for 60 minutes. The top will be crunchy, and the insides will be soft.

Substitution for self-rising flour:  
3 cups flour  
4 tsp baking powder  
1.5 tsp salt
